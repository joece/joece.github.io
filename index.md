### Welcome to My Home Page!

Here is my page for sharing knowledge learned from Software-System-Analysis-and-Design, which about the homework or what I thought in my mind!

Have a look at [my Github Homepage](https://github.com/joece) for more information, maybe you can give me a star if you like it! ^-^ Also, welcome to fork as long as you like~

According to your needs, you can build your own page by imitating mine :)

Last but not least, It's my pleasure to [make a friend](https://joece.github.io/contact.html)
